                    <p style="margin-left: 2.5rem;"> The Internet is a connection of networks that uses the OSI Model and TCP/IP Model to transfer files or 
                        data from one end of devices to another. There are 7 layers on OSI Model and 4 layers on TCP/IP layers 
                        which have a similar function. The Internet has made a positive and negative impact on our life by making 
                        our work easy to do, entertain us, and lazy too. Works that require a lot of time are made easy and 
                        instant by using internet technology. From the purchase of goods to payment of the goods have been made online due to Internet Technologies. 
                        Internet uses a different set of protocols to complete the given tasks such as HTTP, FTP, and telnet.</p>

                       <span>Internet</span> is a group of networks that consists of many local Area Networks that are connected. Internet is run by tens of thousands 
                    of interconnected networks which are run by service providers, individual companies, universities, 
                    governments, and others (Internet Society, 2018). OSI and TCP/IP model is used to transform data and 
                    information from one computer to another connected on the Internet. TCP/IP protocol uses an entire suite 
                    of protocols, in which Internet Protocol(IP) and Transport Control Protocol (TCP) are most important. (WEBSYDIAN, 2021)

                    <h3>There are 7 Layers in the OSI Model:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Application Layer :</b></li><span> User interacts with this layer for web browsing and internet-connected application use application layer.</span> 
                        <li><b>Presentation Layer :</b></li><span> The presentation layer is used for translating data from application formatting to network formatting and vice versa.</span>
                        <li><b>Session Layer :</b></li><span>The session layer is used for establishing and terminating the connection between devices.</span> 
                        <li><b>Transport Layer :</b></li><span> Transport Layer is one of the important layers that transfer data between system and host which is capable of error-checking and data recovery.</span>
                        <li><b>Network Layer : </b></li><span> Network Layer determines the process of sending data to receiving devices by packet forwarding, routing, and addressing.</span>
                        <li><b> Data Link Layer :</b></li><span> Data link layer covers binary into signals and also allows different layers to access media.</span>
                        <li><b>Physical Layer :</b></li><span>Physical Layer is the actual hardware that transmits signals over medium.</span>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>TCP/IP Model uses 4 different layers which are: </h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b> Application Layer :</b></li><span>The application layer is called the Process layer which combines of Session layer, Presentation layer, and Application layer of the OSI Model.</span> 
                        <li><b> Transport Layer :</b></li><span> The transport layer is called the host-to-host layer which has a similar function as the Transport Layer of the OSI Model.</span>
                        <li><b> Internet Layer :</b></li><span> The transport layer is called the host-to-host layer which has a similar function as the Transport Layer of the OSI Model.</span>
                        <li><b> Network Layer :</b></li><span> Network is called Network Interface layer which has a similar function as Data Link layer and Physical Layer.</span>

                    <h3>Working Mechanism of Network Layer:</h3>
                    <p><span>Suppose</span>  two users are using Skype so skype is a network-connected application that uses the application layer to send you videos or photos and messages using different protocols such as Telnet and File Transfer Protocol (FTP).
                        <br><span>The</span>  presentation layer is responsible for translating received data into binary and compressing it with encryption. When the user gets your data, it is also responsible for decrypting it.
                        <br><span> When</span> text files or image files are being downloaded then the Session layer is used in the arrangement of packets and establishes, maintains, and ends communication between devices.
                        <br><span> Transport</span> Layer segments received data and ensure that the segment reaches the correct application by assigning a source, destination port number, and sequence number as well. The transport layer is also responsible for controlling the amount of data transmitted that can be handled by the receiver end devices and ensures that data is successfully transferred by checking for errors also.
                        <br><span> The</span> network layer transmits each segment between devices in form of packets. This layer assigns source and destination IP addresses to each segment and determines the best paths for data transfer.
                        <br><span>Data</span> Link layer adds sender and receiver MAC addresses to the data packet to form a frame and enables frames to be transported using Network Interface Card (NIC). This layer allows the network layer to access media and controls the placement of data and receive of data from media.
                        <br><span>The</span> physical layer converts binary into signals and transmits them over local media depending upon the medium. They can be electrical, light, radio signals, etc.

                    <h3>Some of the common Internet Protocols are TCP/IP protocol, HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol), and FTP (File Transfer Protocol).</h3>                    
                    <ul>
                        <li><b> TCP/IP: </b></li><span>TCP/IP protocol is that guarantees the arrival of any data transmission between two endpoints. It is also called peer-to-peer protocol as only two endpoints are connected.</span>
                        <li><b> HTTP: </b></li><span> HTTP is a protocol that is used to transmit data present on World Wide Web (WWW) which includes text, multimedia, and graphics.</span>
                        <li><b> FTP: </b></li><span> FTP is a protocol that is used during the transmission of files between computers connected by a TCP/IP network.</span>
